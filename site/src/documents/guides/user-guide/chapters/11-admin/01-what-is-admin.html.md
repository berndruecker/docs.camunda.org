Along with the camunda web applications we ship Admin, accessible via <a href="http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/admin/">http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/admin/</a>.
Admin is a small application that allows you to configure users and groups via the engines [Identity Service](ref:#process-engine-identity-service). Furthermore, you can connect camunda Admin to your [LDAP system](ref:#process-engine-identity-service-the-ldap-identity-service).
