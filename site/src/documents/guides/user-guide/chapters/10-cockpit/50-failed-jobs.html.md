    <p>Unresolved incidents of a process instance or a sub process instance are indicated by Cockpit as failed jobs. To localize which instance of a process failed, Cockpit allows you to drill down to the unresolved incident by using the process status dots. Hit a red status dot of the affected instance in the Process Definition View to get an overview of all incidents. The <code>Incidents</code> tab in the <a href="ref:#cockpit-process-instance-detail-view">Detailed Information Panel</a> lists the failed activities with additional information. Furthermore, you have the possibility of going down to the failing instance of a sub process.</p>

## Retry a Failed Job

  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    To resolve a failed job you can use the <button class="btn btn-xs dropdown-toggle"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-repeat"></i> </button> button on the right hand side. Select the corresponding instance in the confirmation dialog so the engine will re-trigger this job and increment its retry value in the database.
